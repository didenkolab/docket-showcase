"""Turn a Cucumber project's cases into tests in the vault.

One task per **case**, not per scenario. That distinction cost a rewrite and is
the whole design:

  a case is a thing that must be true — `ACME-INV-055`, and the tag is its name;
  a scenario is one way of making it true.

One scenario can settle two cases at once (`@ACME-INV-049 @ACME-INV-048` on the
paid-invoice walk), and two scenarios can settle one case from different
directions. Reading a scenario as a test made both of those look like duplicate
ids in a suite that had none, and a real board lost 151 tests to a cleanup that
was fixing nothing.

A scenario nobody tagged has no case, so one is derived for it from the feature
file and the scenario's name (caseid.py). Skipping them was worse: a fifth of a
real suite carries no tag, and a fifth of every run then had nothing to land on.
--write-tags puts the derived id back into the .feature, which freezes it
against a rename; it is the only thing here that touches the automation repo,
and it is off unless asked for.

Read by import-features.sh, which passes the features directory.
