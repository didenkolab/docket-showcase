"""Point each imported test at the work it was written for.

A test that hangs off nothing answers "did it pass". A test linked to the story
it covers answers the question anybody actually asks when a run goes red: what
broke, for whom, and is it shippable. It is also the only way the graph is worth
drawing — story, test, run is a chain, and Obsidian will draw it because every
step of it is a wikilink.

Nobody wrote that link down, so it is derived, from two things the automation
repository already knows:

  the blame — the commit that introduced the scenario's own lines. A suite whose
  subjects read "test(chain): count the settle budget twice (ACME-961)" is a
  suite that recorded, at the time and by hand, which ticket each scenario was
  written for. This is the strong signal.

  the text — a key the scenario or its comments name, "since ACME-1000". Weaker:
  it says the ticket changed the behaviour, not that this scenario covers it.

Both are guesses, so both are written down on the test, and a key the board does
not have is dropped rather than invented. Correct one by editing the test: this
runs again without undoing anything a person did, because it only adds.
