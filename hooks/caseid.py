"""The identity of a scenario, whether or not anybody gave it one.

A case id tag — `@ACME-ADM-002` — is the right identity: it survives rewording,
and rewording is what happens to a scenario's name. But most suites have
scenarios nobody tagged, and until now those simply did not arrive: they were
counted and skipped, so a fifth of the automation was invisible on the board and
a fifth of every run had nowhere to land.

They do not need a person to name them. An id can be derived from the scenario
itself, as long as both sides derive the same one — the importer that creates
the test and the importer that attaches the result. That is all an identity is:
agreement.

Derived from the feature file's name and the scenario's, and from nothing else.
Not the path, because directories get restructured; not the steps, because a
step gets fixed. What is left is the pair a person would use to point at it.

The honest limit: **rename the scenario and the derived id changes**, so the run
history stays with the old test and a new one starts. A tag in the file has no
such problem, which is why `--write-tags` exists and why what it writes is
sequential and readable rather than this hash. Derivation is the floor, not the
goal.
